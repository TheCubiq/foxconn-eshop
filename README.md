# Project Name

## Getting Started

To set up the project for development, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```
2. Install the node modules using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation "installation guide") (preferred) or npm:

   ```sh
    pnpm install
   ```

   > Alternatively, you can use `npm install` instead, but this project was built using `pnpm`.
   >

### Running the Development Build

To start the development server, simply run:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:6969](http://localhost:6969/).

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```
